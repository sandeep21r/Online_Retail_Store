Overview

We have created an online database management system known as dukaan, which serves as a
platform for retailers, shop owners and customers. It allows retailers to increase their gross income by putting their products in front of customers willing to buy them, nonetheless the distance. Also, it gives a platform to customers for a wide range of products they could not accept before. This database management platform provides retailers with extra income and creates employment opportunities for the people as a delivery unit department. This system manages the data of each product enlisted by each registered shop and maintains the transaction between the retailer and users. The system keeps track of every transaction and product. We have also managed the delivery unit as a separate part of the database since it allows us to track each delivery status and keep updating the customer.
