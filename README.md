# Online_Retail_Store

DBMS Project (Dukaan)

Scope: 
        Dukaan is an online application that allows users to buy their daily needs and
        groceries at the lowest price and in the shortest time possible. The User and the
        retailer are connected through the application and can achieve their individual goals.Each Customer will have their unique dukaan ID assigned after signup in the
        application. Then only an ID and password are necessary to log in again to the
        application. The User can order their groceries as they wish unless unavailable; that is, the item is not out of stock. The User will order the groceries delivered to the address they mentioned in their user account. Also, the User can choose their means of payment as they wish and are allowed by the application. The User can add or remove multiple items from his cart and buy the cart at once or buy only one. Item at a time. A return policy is also if the item received is defective or damaged. If the product were reported in time, the amount would be refunded to the User's UPI
        account/ID.

        The retail stores must also register on the online platform, and then they will get
     ![Alt text](<Screenshot (235).png>)   their unique retailer ID. Each retail shop has a manager to keep track of all the
        employee units working at their shops. Each shop has several units, such as a
        packaging unit, dispatching unit, accountancy unit, and data entry unit. Each unit
        performs a specific function to provide the User with the desired accessibility that he wants. The data entry unit receives each order the Customer places, and they will convey the same information to the packaging and dispatching unit to satisfy the Customer's needs. Then the delivery services provide the relationship between the stores and the Customer.
